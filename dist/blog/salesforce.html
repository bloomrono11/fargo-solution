It's a technology used to manage interactions with customers and potential customers. A CRM system helps organisations build customer relationships and streamline processes so they can increase sales, improve customer service, and increase profitability.</p><div class="blog-content-heading-2">How do we define a CRM?</div><p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a strategy for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with your customers and potential customers. It helps you improve your profitability.</p><p>More commonly, when people talk about CRM they are usually referring to a CRM system, a tool which helps with contact management, sales management, workflow processes, productivity and more.</p><p>Customer Relationship Management enables you to focus on your organisation’s relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers. CRM is not just for sales. Some of the biggest gains in productivity can come from moving beyond CRM as a sales and marketing tool and embedding it in your business – from HR to customer services and supply-chain management.</p><div class="blog-content-heading-2">Why CRM matters</div><p>If your business is going to last, you know that you need a strategy for the future. You’ll already have targets relating to sales, business objectives and profitability. But getting up-to-date, reliable information on your progress towards your goals can be tricky. How do you translate the many streams of data coming in from sales teams, customer service staff, marketers and social media monitoring into useful business information?</p><p>Using a CRM system can give you a clear overview of your customers. You can see everything in one place — a simple, customisable dashboard that can tell you a customer's previous history with you, the status of their orders, any outstanding customer service issues, and more.</p><p>You can even choose to include information from their public social media activity – their likes and dislikes, what they are saying and sharing about you. Marketers can use CRM to better understand the pipeline of sales or prospective work coming in, making forecasting simpler and more accurate. You'll have clear visibility of every opportunity or lead, showing you the clear path from enquiries to sales.</p><p>And though it’s traditionally been used as a sales and marketing tool, customer service teams are seeing great benefits from CRM systems. Today’s customer might raise an issue in one channel – say, Twitter – and then switch to email or telephone to resolve it in private. A CRM platform enables you to manage the enquiry across channels without losing track.</p><div class="blog-content-heading-2">Benefits of CRM</div><p>Introducing a CRM platform has many benefits which have been shown to produce real results – including direct improvements to the bottom line. CRM applications have a proven track record of increasing:</p><div class="col-md-4"><ul class="list-group font-weight-bolder"><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">Sales by up to 37%</li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">Sales Productivity by up to 44%</li><li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info">Forecast accuracy by 48%</li></ul></div><ul class="salesforce-target-links smooth-scroll py-3"><li><a href="#salesforceHistroy">Quick recap of Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="#salesforceReason">Why Salesforce?</a></li><li><a href="#salesforce">What is Salesforce?</a></li><li><a href="#salesforceServices">Salesforce Services</a></li><li><a href="#companies">Companies using Salesforce</a></li><li><a href="#example">An example use case with Salesforce</a></li></ul><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center"><div class="view overlay zoom"><img src="../img/blog/salesforce/salesforce-motto.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Salesforce"><div class="mask rgba-green-slight"></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="salesforceHistroy">Salesforce History</div><div class="blog-content-heading-2">How It All Began?</div><p>Before Salesforce, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions were hosted on a company’s own server. Can you imagine the cost and time it took for companies to have their own CRM solutions? Well, it used to take months or even years to set it up and the cost went up to millions of dollars. Even after setting up, they were extremely hard to use. What would be a feasible solution to this? I am sure you guessed it – building an affordable CRM software and delivering it entirely online as a service. This was the main idea behind Salesforce. Started as a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, Salesforce has grown into the fifth-largest software company in the world.</p><div class="blog-content-heading-2">What Made Salesforce An Instant Hit?</div><p>The answer to this is very simple, it was Cloud Computing. Salesforce wasn’t just about a better product at a fraction of the cost. It was about replacing the lengthy installation process and moving everything to the internet. They changed the business model – no more long-term contracts or expensive licensing deals, anyone could use Salesforce with only a simple 50-dollar monthly subscription fee.</p></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column z-index-1000"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="salesforceReason">Why use Salesforce</div><div class="blog-content-heading-2">Benefits of salesforce:</div><ul class="pt-2"><li>As seen in the above image, Salesforce provides you with the fastest path from Idea to App. You can concentrate on building your app using Salesforce tools, rather than building the infrastructure and tools yourself. This can save you years of time and millions of dollars.</li><li>Salesforce customers generally say that it’s unique for three major reasons:<ul><li class="pt-2">Fast – Traditional CRM software can take more than a year to deploy, compare that to months or even weeks with Salesforce.</li><li>Easy – Salesforce wins in the easy to use category hands down. You can spend more time putting it to use and less time figuring it out.</li><li>Effective – Because it is easy to use and can be customized to meet business needs, customers find Salesforce very effective.</li></ul></li><li>Salesforce is in the cloud, so your team can use it from anywhere with access to the internet. If you are a business that is rapidly changing or you are a seasoned company that’s been around for years, your business is probably changing too. Salesforce is completely scalable to your growth.</li><li>Salesforce seamlessly integrates with 3rd party apps. If you want to integrate Salesforce with Gmail you can do it, if you want to integrate it with your accounting software you can do that too. On the other hand, integration is tough with other CRMs.</li><li>Salesforce is affordable, especially if you consider its vast variety of capabilities. Even startups and small business can use Salesforce.</li></ul><div class="blog-content-heading-2">Statistics which make you choose Salesforce</div><p>As of May 2016, Salesforce has had over 150,000 customers across the world. In the world of CRM, Salesforce dominates with a 19.7% market share. Its closest competitors SAP (12.1%), Oracle (9.1%) and Microsoft (6.2%) are far behind. The Salesforce AppExchange features over 2,700 applications which has driven a total of over 3 million installations and more than 70% of Salesforce customers use applications that are listed on the AppExchange. Today, many companies are developing their applications on Salesforce platform or are migrating to Salesforce. This has increased the demand for Salesforce developers and administrators. Currently, Salesforce Architect is one of the hottest skills to have on a tech resume.</p><div class="d-flex flex-row"><div class="view overlay zoom"><img src="../img/blog/salesforce/salesforce-stats.png" class="img-fluid"><div class="mask rgba-green-slight"></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column z-index-1000"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="salesforce">What is Salesforce?</div><p>I hope I have answered your question on why you should choose Salesforce.
