In the world of recruiters, the stakes are a little higher. In a field that can be at times be completely frustrating, or on the flip side, unbelievably rewarding, learning to keep a straight arrow approach is essential to success. You can’t get too high from the wins and you can’t get too low from the losses.</p><p>Think of recruiting as a waterfall. As you start in the profession, only a few rivers and streams flow to the waterfall. As the recruiter begins making more and more connections, those tributaries multiply. Soon the recruiter homes in on specific strategies to make their process more efficient to attract more candidates:</p><ul><li><span>Relationship Building</span></li><li><span>Time Management</span></li><li><span>Social Engagement</span></li><li><span>Target Driven</span></li><li><span>Positive Attitude</span></li></ul><p>After a few months on the job, the flow of the waterfall becomes more forceful and the number of candidates for the recruiter to submit is plentiful.</p><p>These are five skills that will help you move up in the staffing/recruiting industry.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 flex-column"><div class="blog-content-heading">Relationship Building</div><p>There’s networking, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleyzalis/2018/02/23/forget-networking-relationship-building-is-the-best-career-shortcut/" target="_blank">then there’s relationship building</a>. Relationship building puts networking on its back and digs down into the trenches to extend beyond just a general introduction. Putting additional effort into getting to know a person, says more than just a handshake. It makes it memorable.</p><p>A lot of people believe they can work behind their computer screen or phone to get in touch with people. Extending an invitation for the candidate to meet for a cup of coffee either in your office or out at a coffee shop will allow you to get to know one another.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 flex-column"><div class="blog-content-heading">Time Management</div><p>Through the ups and downs of recruiting, there are also beginnings and ends. To keep track of it all requires the ability to organize effectively. One way for a recruiter to do this is to <a href="https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/time-management-recruiters/" target="_blank">score your candidates</a>. Are your candidates exclusive, open to new markets, or immediately available? Scoring candidates put a priority on your own response rate.</p><p>Another valuable lesson from time management is putting a price on your time spent. Imagine billing yourself out for $1,000 per hour. Seem too much? Thinking with this mindset will put things into perspective regarding importance.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 flex-column"><div class="blog-content-heading">Social Engagement</div><p>The social media platforms have exploded into the recruiting world and they don’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. For recruiters, LinkedIn can be a valuable source for new connections. Over 75% of people that changed jobs <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf" target="_blank">used LinkedIn to inform</a> their career decision. This means candidates are actively using the platform to reach out to recruiters to find their next job.</p><p>Social media platforms are also where candidates and recruiters alike go to check on each other. Candidates look for company culture and values. Recruiters look for previous experience and direction of the candidate.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="blog-content-heading">Target Driven</div><p>There’s no way around this. To be an effective recruiter looking to move up, you must be driven. There’s one job and hundreds of possible candidates for the role. Recruiters must thrive in a competitive environment. If you’re not the one getting the perfect candidate, someone else is.</p><p>In order to attain your goals, it’s important to understand the market you’re in. <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-green/how-do-you-become-a-great-salesperson-most-people-forget-to-do-this-1-thing.html" target="_blank">Knowledge is power</a>. The more you know about every variable of the industry, the more confident the candidate will feel in trusting you.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8 flex-column"><div class="blog-content-heading">Positive Attitude</div><p>“A positive attitude causes a chain reaction of positive thoughts, events, and outcomes. It is a catalyst and it sparks extraordinary results.” That quote came from Wade Boggs, a hall of fame 3rd baseman for the Red Sox that accumulated more than 3,000 hits in his career and plays a sport that considers reaching base safely 3 out of 10 times, a great average.</p><p>Recruiting is as much motivational speaking as it is selling a job to someone. A job search can take anywhere from one month all the way up to two years for some people. Keeping a positive attitude while speaking with an <a href="http://people-corner.com/the-successful-recruiter-balancing-a-positive-attitude-with-an-honest-perspective/" target="_blank">honest perspective of the open position</a> to the candidate will add to your success as a recruiter.</p><p>Tackling these recruiting skills will lead to more job placements. More job placements lead to promotions. Staying the course and keeping the passion elevated can change people’s lives.</p><p>At Fargo Solutions, make your next job search easy by working with one of our highly skilled professionals.
