It is now offered in three separate packages:</p><p class="mb-0"><b>Jira Core:</b> The basic Jira project management platform.</p><p class="mb-0"><b>Jira Software:</b> Offers all functions of Jira Core, but also includes additional Agile functionality.</p><p class="mb-0"><b>Jira Service Desk:</b> Meant for IT professionals or other forms of service desks. This guide will ignore Jira Service Desk since it is not relevant to project management.</p><p class="mb-0"><b>Jira History:</b>When it comes to project management software, I see Jira as a true comeback story. Years ago I found this tool as a plain and confusing mess of a platform, but over time it has refined itself into a competent force to be reckoned with in the software world.</p><p>However, this isn’t a review of Jira. Instead, this is an overview of what Jira really is, what it is used for, and what core functionality it has to offer its users.</p><ul class="jira-target-links smooth-scroll"><li><a href="#jiraUse">Jira Uses</a></li><li><a href="#jiraKanban">Jira Kanban</a></li><li><a href="#jiraScrum">Jira Kanban</a></li><li><a href="#jiraContentMngmt">Jira Kanban</a></li><li><a href="#jiraSoftDev">Jira Software Development</a></li><li><a href="#jiraIssueTrack">Jira Issue Tracking</a></li><li><a href="#jiraProjectMngmt">Jira Project Management</a></li><li><a href="#jiraNews">Jira News</a></li><li><a href="#downloadLinkJira">Jira Download Link</a></li></ul><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center"><div class="view overlay zoom"><img src="../img/blog/jira/jira-software.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Jira Software"><div class="mask rgba-green-slight"></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column power-bi-download-links"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="jiraUse">What is Jira used for?</div><p>Since its inception, Jira has grown to encompass all kinds of project management types.</p><p>The platform leverages all kinds of project management skills, including software development, Agile project management, bug tracking, scrum management, content management, marketing, professional service management, and so much more.</p></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column power-bi-download-links z-index-1000"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="jiraKanban">Using Jira for kanban</div><p>I’ve been on a kanban kick for the past few weeks and Jira is a great option to go with if you’re looking for this type of workflow style.</p><p>In the last three years, Jira’s parent company, Atlassian, acquired Trello, another prominent kanban project management tool. This led to serious upgrades in Jira’s user experience and user interface, including major improvements in their kanban system.</p><p>Setting up a kanban board in Jira is simple. Either you create one during the initial setup process or you add one to your existing project.</p><p>The initial setup process will ask you what you are looking to use Jira for, the level of experience you have with Jira, and the type of management style you are looking to use.</p><p>Once you select “kanban” then it will walk you through the Jira tutorial for creating your new workflow board.</p><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center"><div class="view overlay zoom"><img src="../img/blog/jira/jira-kanban.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Jira Kanban"><div class="mask rgba-green-slight"></div></div></div><p class="pt-2">If you’re creating one in your existing project, all you have to do is click on your project name on the left hand menu and select “create board.”</p><p>Using this management style in Jira will give you a full picture of the project you are working on including which tasks are smoothly moving along the workflow and which ones are bottlenecking the process.</p><p>Jira’s kanban workflow also operates on a drag-and-drop system for tasks, making it easier for you and your team to move tasks along as they see fit.</p><p>You can use this style to manage marketing efforts, track bug fixes in your software, track software development, and all kinds of other projects. It’s a simple, yet elegant process that teams of all experience levels will understand.</p></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column power-bi-download-links z-index-1000"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="jiraScrum">Using Jira for scrum</div><p>Jira also allows you to create scrum boards that track your sprints and backlog in order to execute projects in a quick and efficient manner.</p><p>If your project is massive and requires many steps to complete, Jira’s scrum board will help you simplify the execution phase using smaller sprints.</p><p>In order to set up a scrum board in Jira, all you have to do is either select “scrum” as a management style during the initial setup process or create a new scrum board in your existing project in the same manner that you would for creating a new kanban workflow.</p><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-center"><div class="view overlay zoom"><img src="../img/blog/jira/jira-scrum.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Jira Scrum"><div class="mask rgba-green-slight"></div></div></div><p class="pt-2">You’ll select specific tasks from your backlog and place them into separate short-duration sprints.</p><p>Jira also sets up your sprints into mini-kanban board views, allowing you to focus on the tasks at hand without the clutter of every project task in your view. The best part is the efficiency in which you can switch between kanban views and scrum views.</p><p>Jira makes the scrum board creation process simple by allowing you to port over the steps you created on your kanban board. These steps will help you specify where these tasks are in the “progress” stage.</p></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 flex-column power-bi-download-links"><div class="blog-content-heading text-capitalize" id="jiraContentMngmt">Using Jira for content management</div><p>This was my very first use for Jira and it still holds up in this regard.

Project roadmap</h5><p>This is one of Jira’s key features for software and product development teams. The project roadmap allows you to create a clear vision of the product you are creating, including a timetable, direction, list of tasks to complete, and both short and long term goals.</p><p>These roadmaps provide support for:</p><ul><li>Executives looking to present the outline of product development to the project stakeholders as well as track goals and metrics for their teams.</li><li>Development teams looking for a blueprint that lays out the entire process for completing a project.</li><li>Sales teams looking to promote new features and benefits to their customer base.</li></ul><p>This roadmap functions as a work breakdown structure for your team to digest at any point in the project and reorganize at any time. It is essentially the backbone of your project management plan in Jira.</p><h5>2. Detailed reporting</h5><p>Jira offers exceptional reporting capabilities that are detailed, yet simple to understand and use.</p><p>Jira’s standard reporting system covers everything you’d expect from a project management platform such as:</p><ul><li>Created vs. completed tasks</li><li>User workloads</li><li>Task conclusion times</li><li>Time since issues</li><li>Average age of issues</li></ul><p>Jira tracking also covers Agile metrics and formats, such as:</p><ul><li>Scrum board tracking</li><li>Control charts</li><li>Cumulative flow charts</li><li>Burndown charts</li><li>And sprint reports</li></ul><p>Not to mention if you’re looking for additional reporting capabilities, Jira’s add-ons include additional reporting tools for you to integrate with.</p><h5>3. Time tracking</h5><p>It’s important for any manager to understand the time spent on tasks and issues in order to plan ahead for future sprints in your project life cycle. Jira provides time tracking that covers several different parameters and views, including:</p><ul><li>Working hours per day</li><li>Working hours per week</li><li>Time formats: days, hours, weeks, etc.</li></ul><p>It doesn’t end there. If Jira’s time tracking doesn’t go deep enough or you already use a third-party time tracking application, the Atlassian Marketplace offers plenty of integrations with more advanced time tracking programs.</p><h5>4. Mobile application</h5><p>This is a feature that I feel is severely overlooked by software users of all kinds, but Jira’s mobile application is exceptionally helpful for project managers that are constantly on the move and don’t have time to spend hours in front of a desktop.</p><p>Using the mobile app you can manage your projects and backlogs, create and edit your tasks or issues, and receive notifications about project updates.</p><p>What’s more, the Jira mobile app is available for iOS and Android phones and tablets, so you won’t miss out on anything no matter which device you use.</p></div></div></div><hr class="hr-light"><div class="container pt-2"><div class="row"><div class="col"><div class="blog-content-heading" id="jiraProjectMngmt">Learn more about Jira and other
