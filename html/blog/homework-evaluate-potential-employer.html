                        href="../careers.html" target="_blank">
                    experienced candidates</a>. Often, because interviews can be stressful, candidates forget to learn
                    about the employer. How can you fully commit to a job when you don’t know anything about the
                    company?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take the time to evaluate the company you are interviewing with. Some of it requires some behind the
                    scenes research, while the rest is done at the interview. Here are few tips to make sure you know
                    what you’re getting into.

                <div class="blog-content-heading">Establish Your Expectations</div>
                <p>
                    The first step in the evaluation should be establishing your expectations. Make a list of the
                    qualities that you want in a company, as well as the perks you’d like from your employer. Once you
                    have a feel for what you’re looking for you can more accurately search for information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that companies are interviewing a range of candidates, they may not know what you’re
                    looking for. If you know what to ask about you can do some digging and make a much more informed
                    decision on the position.

                <p>
                    While candidates usually prepare themselves for the traditional interview questions, many forget to
                    ask the right questions of their employer. Not only can asking the right questions to set you apart
                    from other applicants, but it is also a great way to get more information about the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The type of questions you ask your interviewer should stem from what you need to know in to fully
                    evaluate the position. This means the questions you chose to prioritize should be well thought out.
                    <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/questions-ask-an-interviewer/" target="_blank">
                        It should go back and forth; the interview should not be an interrogation</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Come prepared with a few questions about the culture, training and development, and other important
                    factors. Even questions as simple as “Why do you like working here?” can give you valuable
                    knowledge. If you have notes with you, you’ll be less likely to forget to interview your
                    interviewer.

                <p>
                    Many sites such as Glassdoor and Monster offer the ability for companies to be anonymously reviewed
                    by current and former employees. This can be valuable info for candidates, but it should also be
                    taken with a grain of salt. Anonymity can invite reviewers to be much harsher than they would be in
                    person. Pay attention to factors that are repeated across many reviews, as they generally point to
                    the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, search social media streams, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, to see what people are saying
                    about the company and what news the company posts about itself.

                        Checking real-time social media, as well as an anonymous employer review site like Glassdoor</a>,
                    can give you a good picture of the company and its culture.

                <p>
                    Outside of doing your own research and making sure to ask the right questions, a lot can be learned
                    by picking up on cues in your interactions with a company.
                    <a href="https://www.thisisinsider.com/job-interview-red-flags-2018-5" target="_blank">
                        Pay attention to how your interviewer runs the interview</a>.
                    Are they asking questions to get a feel for your strengths or are they trying hard to sell you the
                    position?
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you see other employees, do people look generally happy or are everyone stoic and quiet?
                    Another thing to watch for are the questions you ask that the interviewer dodges or deflects. If you
                    are concerned with the potential for advancement and training, you should be wary of an interviewer
                    who avoids answering your questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although it seems stressful, every part of your interview experience can give you valuable
                    information. Do your research, ask questions that matter to you and pay attention to the atmosphere.
                    All these things will provide you with a good look at what working at the company would be.
