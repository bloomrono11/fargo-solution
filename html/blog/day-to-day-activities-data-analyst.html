                <h3 id="daily">Day to Day activities of a Data Analyst </h3>
                <p>
                    Generally speaking, a data analyst will retrieve and gather data, organize it and use it to reach
                    meaningful conclusions. “Data analysts’ work varies depending on the type of data that they’re
                    working with (sales, social media, inventory, etc.) as well as the specific client project,” says
                    Stephanie Pham, analyst for <a href="http://www.porternovelli.com/" target="_blank">Porter
                    Novelli</a>.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Companies in nearly every industry can benefit from the work of data analysts, from healthcare
                    providers to retail stores to fast food chains. The insights that data analysts bring to an
                    organization can be valuable to employers who want to know more about the needs of their consumer or
                    end user.</p>
                <p>

                    Regardless of which industry they work in, data analysts can expect to spend their time developing
                    systems for collecting data and compiling their findings into reports that can help improve their
                    company.</p>
                <p>

                    Analysts can be involved in any part of the analysis process. In a data analyst role, you could be
                    included in everything from setting up an analytics system to providing insights based on the data
                    you collect—you may even be asked to train others in your data-collection system.</p>
                <p>

                    Now that you have an idea of what data analysts do in general, you’re ready to dig into the
                    specifics of life on the job as a data analyst.

                <h3 id="responsibilities">What are some common Data Analyst responsibilities? </h3>
                <p>We enlisted some experts to help you get a sneak peek of the daily duties of a typical data
                    analyst.</p>

                <h4>1. Producing reports</h4>

                <p>
                    “As an analyst, I spend a significant amount of time producing and maintaining both internal and
                    client-facing reports,” says Casey Pearson, marketing analyst at
                    <a href="http://www.delphicdigital.com/" target="_blank">Delphic Digital</a>. Those reports give
                    management insights about new trends on the horizon as well as areas the company may need to improve
                    upon.</p>
                <p>

                    Writing up a report isn’t as simple as throwing numbers onto a blank page and sending it to your
                    manager. “Successful data analysts understand how to create narratives with data,” says Jess Kendra,
                    manager of analytics at Porter Novelli. “To remain valuable, the reports, answers and insights that
                    data analysis provides have to be understood by the next decision-maker, who frequently is not an
                    analyst.”</p>

                <h4>2. Spotting patterns</h4>
                <p>
                    The most effective data analysts are able to use data to tell a story. In order to produce a
                    meaningful report, a data analyst first has to be able to see important patterns in the data.
                    “At the base level, data is used to find trends and insights that we can use to make
                    recommendations to our clients,” Pham says.</p>

                <p>
                    Reporting in regular increments, such as weekly, monthly or quarterly, is important since it helps
                    an analyst notice significant patterns. “They all contribute to an overarching time frame where we
                    can see trends over time,” Pham adds.</p>

                <h4>3. Collaborating with others</h4>

                <p>
                    Surprised to see this on the list? The word “analyst” might make you think of someone working apart
                    from the rest of the company, but that’s far from the truth. The wide variety of data analyst roles
                    and responsibilities means you’ll collaborate across many other departments in your organization
                    including marketers, executives and salespeople. You’ll also likely collaborate closely with those
                    who work in data science like data architects and database developers.</p>

                <p>
                    Being able to communicate well is important. “Your success is dependent on your ability to work with
                    people—the people you are gathering the research questions from, peers you collaborate with to
                    execute the work and the people you deliver the final presentation to,” Kendra says.</p>

                <h4>4. Collecting data and setting up infrastructure</h4>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most technical aspect of an analyst’s job is collecting the data itself. This often
                    means working together with web developers to optimize data collection, according to Pearson.</p>
                <p>
                    Streamlining this data collection is key for data analysts. They work to develop routines that can
                    be automated and easily modified for reuse in other areas. Analysts keep a handful of specialized
                    software and tools in their arsenal to help them accomplish this.

                <p>With all that in mind, you might be wondering about another prominent data role—the data scientist.
                    While it’s safe to assume there is some overlap in the type of work they do, there are significant
                    differences between data analysts and data scientists.</p>

                <p> Since the role of a data scientist is relatively new and sometimes nebulous, those in the field have
                    worked to define and differentiate it from that of the data analyst. Let’s break it down based on
                    skills and job duties.</p>

                </ul>
                </div>
                <h4>Data scientists:<sup>1</sup></h4>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                <ul class="list-group font-weight-bolder">
                   <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info"> Have strong math and statistical skills</li>
                   <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info"> Have a strong business acumen</li>

                   <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-info"> Make predictions based on data trends</li>

                </ul></div>

                <p>Though data analysts and data scientists have different backgrounds and strengths, keep in mind that
                    these roles can be a little squishy in how they’re defined. This means responsibilities may change
                    depending on the organization.</p>

                <h3 id="analytics">Types of data analytics </h3>
                <p>At its core, data analytics is about answering questions and making decisions. And just as there are
                    different types of questions, there are also different types of data analytics depending on what
                    you’re hoping to accomplish. While there’s no set-in-stone glossary of these types of data
                    analytics, the
                    <a href="https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/4-types-of-data-analytics" target="_blank">folks at
                        ScienceSoft</a>
                    do an excellent job breaking this work down into four primary areas:<sup>2</sup></p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark"> Descriptive analytics answers, “What happened?”</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark"> Diagnostic analytics answers, “Why did something happen?”</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark"> Predictive analytics answers, “What is likely to happen?”</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-action list-group-item-dark"> Prescriptive analytics answers, “What action should be taken?”</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Data analysts can tailor their work and solution to fit the scenario. For instance, if a
                    manufacturer is plagued with delays and unplanned stoppages, a diagnostic analytics approach could
                    help identify what exactly is causing these delays. From there, other forms of analysis can be used
                    for fixing these issues.

                <p>Data analysts rely on various tools to collect and make sense of their data. Kendra’s team uses
                    specialized tools to efficiently gather data from social media, news sites and magazines as well as
                    tools to sort and categorize data to visualize that data for reports and presentations.</p>

                <p>
                    Data that is collected without proper examination is worthless. A data analyst’s true job is to add
                    value to a company—either their own or their clients’. “Through making the data we collect
                    insightful and easy to understand, we provide additional value to our clients to help them make
                    informed decisions for their business,” Pearson says.</p>
