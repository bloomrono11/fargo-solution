                    In the financial industry, regulations are created to protect investors and markets while promoting
                    stability. Changes to these regulations can be disruptive as financial institutions need to take the
                    extra time to adjust to the new rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2008 financial crisis shook the world, and strict regulations were rolled out as a result. Today
                    looks vastly different to back then. A new robust market is upon us, as is a new administration that
                    has begun to scale back some of the pain points financial institutions have been held to after the
                    crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As regulations continue to change, how are financial entities working on adapting to them?

                <p>
                    The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in 2010 as a response to the collapse of the financial crisis to
                    improve the safety of the financial system. This instilled government regulation into financial
                    institutions all over while also requiring stress tests for banks to conduct to ensure they could
                    cover their loans. This process was deemed cost-heavy and time–consuming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, President Donald Trump is in office and has begun to scale back these programs. In 2018, he
                    signed into law “The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act.”

                    freely. The provisions from this new regulatory reduction law hope to keep banks compliant while
                    also reducing costs.

                <p>
                    As Fintech has changed the financial banking game with products for consumers such as Venmo, a
                    person-to-person money-transfer app, regtech is beginning to gain traction as a tool for the
                    financial industry to capitalize on and make compliance easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regtech combines big data with machine learning and predictive analytics to manage risk.

                        According to <span class="font-italic">Jo Ann Barefoot</span></a>, “They
                    <strong>Regtech</strong> offer the tantalizing prospect
                    of improving regulatory results and cutting costs, at the same time.” This is a hugely beneficial
                    technology for the financial industry to adopt. The painstaking process of keeping up with
                    compliance just became more accessible.

                    was banks not having the data architectures and information technology to support the broad
                    management of financial risks. Now with Regtech, data is used to find solutions in:

                    Data is everywhere, and everyone wants your data. Data helps financial institutions calculate the
