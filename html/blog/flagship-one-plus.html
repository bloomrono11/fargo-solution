                <p>The world of OnePlus has evolved dramatically over the years. Once seen as the flagship-busting
                    affordable phone, that vision has somewhat dissipated: the brand has become a higher-end,
                    diversifying its output across a multitude of devices within a series, with pricing that, while
                    still less than the big boys, has inevitably crept up release by release.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For the OnePlus 8 - the current entry phone of the 2020 series - that takes us to a place where you
                    still get an absolute stack of goodness for your money. But with the inevitability of a OnePlus 8T
                    later down the line, the rumour of a OnePlus 8 Lite, and this handset's launch alongside the larger
                    and better-equipped OnePlus 8 Pro, is this model still the worthy flagship-buster it purports to be?
                </p>

                <p class="pt-2 text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Design & Display</p>
                <ul>

                <p>
                    We spend a lot of our time jostling between phones. Whether budget long-lasters like the Moto G8
                    Power, or newcomer flagships such as the Oppo Find X2 Pro (which, in many ways, is the same as the
                    OnePlus 8 Pro - unsurprisingly as the two companies are owned by the same BBK Electronics umbrella).
                    In terms of price, the OnePlus 8 sits in the middle of those two examples, but when we first lifted
                    our turquoise-tinted handset out of the box we were immediately taken to flagship land. In terms of
                    pizzazz, the OnePlus 8 has certainly got it.

                    <p>
                        That rear green-blue finish - which sheens beautifully in daylight and is rather impressive at
                        resisting fingerprint smears - makes this one mean, green flagship machine.</p>
                    <p>

                        But it's not just the colour of this review handset that's the only eye-catching feature.
                        There's also the screen, which offers inky blacks from its OLED make-up, plus subtle curved
                        edges that give it heightened craftsmanship.</p>
                    <p>

                        There's also a very of-the-minute feature: a 90Hz refresh rate. This means the OnePlus 8 has a
                        50 per cent bump over typical screens, adding additional smoothness to animations and gaming,
                        for example, although it's not the 120Hz panel of its OnePlus 8 Pro big brother.</p>
                    <p>

                        There's been a lot of talk about higher refresh rates in phones and whether they make a big
                        difference or not. Some people won't see much benefit, really, while others may be more astute
                        to those extra cycles on offer. We can see a marginal bonus to scrolling through text, but
                        that's about it.
                    </p>

                        Really, though, we'd rather that OnePlus had been a little more gentle in its approach to
                        contrast: while the settings offer various screen settings, whichever one you choose, paired
                        with low brightness, makes this screen excessive in contrasty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing as this screen is supposed to be very colour accurate, we can only assume that's not
                        across the full brightness curve - because we've only been seeing that in evening times, when
                        it's dark; when the screen is gloriously bright we'd not complain whatsoever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sat next to our year-old Huawei P30 Pro, the OnePlus 8 takes a similar approach to scale; its of
                        similar dimensions and thickness, making it sit ideally in one hand without absurd
                        thumb-reaching to activate various settings. The camera unit doesn't protrude too much to the
                        rear, either, which is an increasingly rare yet pleasing design feature.

                        Depending on whether you're embedded in the world of OnePlus or not, you might find the
                        arrangement of buttons on the phone a little unusual for an Android device: there's a power
                        button on the left (when facing the screen), with a switch above to toggle between silent,
                        vibrate and loud. On the opposite side is where you'll find the volume up/down rocker switch.
                        Having used an Oppo phone for some weeks now, we find this arrangement to make great sense -
                        it's more elegant for combination button-pressing, such as when making a screengrab.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The design also purports to offer some water-resilience this time around, although there's no
                        official IP rating (like there is with the Pro model). Even so, that's still a welcome addition
                        - and it's likely implemented in a similar way to Motorola's phones, which are robust in their
                        proofing, but don't follow the IP protocol (arguably for the sake of cost saving).

                    <p>Wrap all of that up and, while there are very minor niggles, the OnePlus 8 is a very fetching and
                        accomplished handset. Take into account that it's some hundreds cheaper than its flagship
                        competition and, frankly, if you lined one up side-by-side with various pricier bits of kit we
                        suspect many wouldn't know the difference.

                        Internally there's zero corner cutting either - which is a very OnePlus approach. This company
                        has long been bringing the top-drawer processors into its range, minus the typical price
                        association. In the OnePlus 8 that means the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, paired with 12GB RAM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short: very close to the most powerful you could buy at the time of writing (sure, there's
                        more advanced RAM, as per the Pro model, while various cooling systems that other devices - such
                        as gaming phones - can also aid with performance).

                <p>This translates really well in performance terms too. Whether it's jumping between apps, or settling
                    into a proper gaming session, you can throw anything at this phone without giving it the hiccups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our PUBG Mobile and South Park Phone Destroyer sessions have been going just swimmingly - even more
                    so because there's a Gaming Mode, including Fnatic mode, which can be customised to permit only
                    certain interruptions. There's a lot of detail here, from what can bypass Do Not Disturb (DND), to
                    brightness level fixing and so forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's indicative of the software at work here: OnePlus has Oxygen OS, which is its system built
                    over the top of Google's Android 10 operating system. Although OnePlus life didn't start out like
                    this, it's evolved elegantly and is just a really smooth and well arranged software offering.
                    There's no bloat or bother like you'll find in many other makers' solutions, even Google Assistant
                    is integrated without the need for a separate app.</p>

                <div class="blog-content-heading text-uppercase">Improved Connectivity</div>
                <p>There's also 5G connectivity, although in lockdown and away from a suitable network, and without a
                    registered 5G SIM, this isn't something we were able to test for this review.</p>

                <p>
                    So we've got powerful processing, good software, useful modes - surely something's got to give?
                    Well, apparently not. Even the battery life is pretty stellar. We've been churning through 16 hours
                    from wake-up to bedtime and the phone has consistently made it with 30 per cent battery remaining,
                    or thereabouts (tested over six consecutive days). That's been with hours of screen time, including
                    gaming, plus some tethering, work apps, and so forth.</p>

                <div>
                    <img>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Should you need to rapidly top-up then the inclusion of Warp Charge 30T means it's pretty quick too.
                    You could add 50 per cent to an empty battery in just 23 minutes. However, there's no wireless
                    charging, unlike the 8 Pro - but we don't think that's a big deal really, given the way most people
                    use their phones.

                    One area where previous OnePlus phones haven't blown us away is in the camera department. While the
                    OnePlus 8 certainly improves some elements, it's still not quite got the all-conquering approach
                    sewn up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First thing's first: unlike the Pro, the standard OnePlus model doesn't have an optical zoom. It
                    provides a 2x digital zoom within the software, but that's it.

                    The OnePlus 8 does comprise three cameras to the rear though: its main sensor, at 48-megapixels; its
                    ultra-wide (0.6x), at 16MP; and a low-resolution macro for close-up shooting.

                    The main sensor, which utilises a Sony IMX586, is accomplished in terms of delivery and sharpness.
                    We've taken a bunch of photos using the main lens, followed by the ultra-wide for comparison, and
                    the clarity you get from the higher-res main sensor is significantly better.

                <p>
                    Do note that it outputs at 12MP by default, using a four-in-one technique called oversampling, which
                    aids in creating an even more detailed output than the full-size 48MP shot would offer - although
                    this ultra-high resolution option can be switched on, if you so wish.

                    The camera app works pretty fluidly, too, with simple touchscreen controls and various modes to
                    choose from.

                    The macro mode doesn't auto-engage, though, you'll need to pick that from the top row to get it to
                    kick in. When it does you can shoot very close-up to subjects, which is fun, but like all macro
                    cameras the quality has limits - and the physical size of the output is also small, which is fine
                    for a phone, but not for prints or much wider use.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Overall the OnePlus 8 has cameras that are perfectly suited to shooting in a variety of conditions.
                    We suspect you'll be pleased with the results you get on the phone itself, or for sharing on social
                    media, just don't expect to get epic prints from a camera of this calibre. It's capable enough, but
                    it's not as versatile or top-end as some of the pricier flagships out there - perhaps unsurprising,
                    as camera components are now a significant part of a smartphone's make-up and, therefore, price.

                    Although the OnePlus 8 is the entry model to the series, this phone is anything but 'entry'. It's
                    got oodles of processing power, super smooth software (which even scrolls smoother thanks to that
                    90Hz screen), and 5G connectivity for future-proofing.

                    The overly contrasty screen at low brightness and a camera setup that can't compete with the
                    absolute best are small putbacks to an otherwise accomplished feature set.

                    Dressed in its Glacier Green finish the OnePlus 8 looks like one mean, green flagship machine.
                    Because that's the thing: despite costing hundreds less than the full-fat flagships out there, this
                    phone still hits all the necessary features to truly impress, without ripping you off.

                <p>

                    Want a bit extra? The Pro is larger, has more camera versatility, a faster screen refresh rate and,
                    but of course, costs a bit more too. But it's not out-of-this-world expensive - so could make a
                    great step-up solution if that's what you're looking for.
