                    Air-tickets.us does not act as principal but makes arrangements with third-party vendors, such as,
                    but not limited to airlines, hotels, car rental agencies, tour operators and consolidators and
                    activities suppliers (each referred to as "Travel Supplier") for travel-related services which

                    "Travel Product").</p>

                <p>
                    If you make a booking for a travel product through our site, that booking is made with the travel

                    booking or the travel product because we have no involvement in creating the description of the
                    travel product, in defining the price and any fees, and in providing the travel products that you
                    book. If you have any issues or disputes around your booking and/or the travel product, you agree to
                    address and resolve these with the travel provider and not with us.</p>

                <p>
                    Air-tickets.us, in providing travel services, does not endorse, guarantee or insure the products or

                    reimbursement to you from any loss as a result of the financial condition of such supplier. In the
                    situations in which a supplier defaults prior to providing services you may pursue any recourse
                    against the supplier for a refund, as permitted by law or statute.</p>

                <p>
                    Once certain travel products are booked and paid for, there may be a penalty involved for
                    cancellations and refunds. We do not have control over these charges on the tickets, which may be
                    different (lower or higher) than the fare collected. Discounts offered may vary depending on a
                    number of factors including used airline tickets, booking class, destination, time of year (low, mid
                    or peak season), advance notice provided, minimum stay requirements fulfilled and flight overloaded.
